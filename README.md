An intellectual property violation-free mini-game project I started to explore the possibilities of the p5 programming language and p5.play library. The eventual goal is to add in a variety of environmental elements (wind, rain, temperature) reflective of the weather wherever the user is playing using the OpenWeather API, basically creating a gamified version of the standard weather app everyone has on their phone. CapeMan would have to battle against not only those pesky birds but also Mother Nature, meanwhile the user sees that it's 90 degrees outside by noticing CapeMan profusely sweating and constantly slowing down.
